        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am thrilled to announce my long-awaited career transformation into web development has begun! My name is Julian Franklin. For the last seven years, I have been a top-notch, highly recognized, elementary school educator. Now, as I commence this new chapter, it is important to hold tight to the joy and success I have experienced in education. By leveraging my aptitude for creativity, organization, planning, agility, and perfection, I know I will continue to produce exceptional products just like I did in education. I am excited to learn and apply the skills Georgia Tech will develop in me as a Software Engineer.
        <br><br>
        It is my drive for learning and growing that has inspired this new adventure. And what an adventure it has been already! Every day I become more fluent in HTML development, using CSS and JavaScript, getting to put my creativity to the test. There is no doubt over the next few months, Georgia Techâ€™s program, combined with my persistence, will forge me into a talented software engineer.
        <br><br>
        Soon I will be ready to showcase my new skills in the workforce, and reveal to my employer what an amazing program Georgia Tech is running! Upon completion of their program, I will finally get to contribute my unique skills to a team of like-minded, passionate professionals! </p>
